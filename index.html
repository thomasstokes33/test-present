        <p>It is important to remember that html is structure, css is design and JavaScript is the interact.</p>
        <p>When combined they are very powerful. I would recommed first taking the basic codecademy tutorial on HTML(so up to bot not including tables). 
            Then the microsoft learn modules <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-simple-website >https://
                docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-simple-website/</a> . The codecademy tutorial allows you to understand the
            basics and the microsoft lessons use this new found knowleddge. I would then reccommend finishing the codecademy tutorials on html, css and javascript
            interlinked with https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/ . This site is beautifully designed and a nice break from the occasionally repetitve(albeit addicting)
             interface of codecademy.

        <p>The main principle is that html is the text and structure, css shows where and how everything is displayed and javascript adds any sort of applet 
            . Furthermore it connects to the real world to understand say time. 
        </p>
        <p>The main thing to understand is the tags. The HTML does not take into account returns and whitespace it uses 
            the tags to define areas of text and the labels or tags explain what to do with it. This text is contained within &ltp&gt &lt/p&gt
            The opening tag is the start and is between &lt and &gt. The second one is very similar, but has a / before the tag symbolising it is the closing tag.
